#Choosing a Hub :bowtie:

One of the core principals of Red#Matrix is the freedom to host yourself or "shop" around for a host.  The ability to choose how close to home your content's data is stored based on how close your admin is, which could be as close as you.

Being an open source project people have been free to create a mashup of technologies to assist in the working function of the core of the system, to add [software addons] (https://github.com/friendica/red/tree/master/app) and to graphically represent the statistics properties of the project itself.  

##Hub "Shopping", Statistics and Technology Profiles

When looking for the hub for you a couple resources are prevalent right now to do your consumer investigation.

1. [Red Stats] (redstats.tarine.net) for a general overview of hub statistics

- When you **click on the little eye beside the the hub domain** you are shown
  - Activity of the Hub's channels
  - Version of Redmatrix running
  - Openness to registration  (private,approve,open)
  - Location of server -Geo IP
  - Default Language supported (Although this can be changed - ask your admin)
  - A link to the administrater for the hubs page 
  - Add-ons and features included in the initial hub.

2. [Built With] (https://www.builtwith.com) for a fundamental hardware software technology profile of the hub domains.
- One can type in the search box the domain of there hub and be brought to the technology profile of that page
- There are also browser extensions *in the resources nav bar* for Firefox, Chrome and Safari.


####Some reasons one might want to shop around for a hub:
- You've caught word of Red#Matrix and **would like to first try it out** before dedicating the energies of *hosting the platform yourself*.  
- You are looking to take advantage of **addon's included** on another site that is not immediate to your own...yet *(Admins are friendly talk to them about all your dreams)* 
- You are looking for some **in case of downtime** hub property to clone your profile too.
- Someone is supplying a **unique domain name** that inspires a channel you'd like to relate to that domain
