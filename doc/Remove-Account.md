Remove Account
==============

It is presently not possible to remove an account without asking your site administrator for assistance. 
We'll have better doco when somebody finishes that bit.


Remove Channel
==============

Visit the URL 

	https://yoursite/removeme 

(replace 'yoursite' with the domain name of your Red Matrix site). 
You will need to confirm your password and the channel you are currently logged into will be removed. 

This is irreversible.

If you have identity clones on other sites this only removes the channel instance which exists
on this site.
