[b]About[/b]

The Red Matrix is a decentralized communication network, which aims to provide communication that is censorship-resistant, privacy-respecting, and thus free from the oppressive claws of contemporary corporate communication giants. These giants function primarily as spy networks for paying clients of all sorts and types, in addition to monopolizing and centralizing the Internet; a feature that was not part of the original and revolutionary goals that produced the World Wide Web. 

The Red Matrix is free and open source.  It is designed to scale from a $35 Raspberry Pi, to top of the line AMD and Intel Xeon-powered multi-core enterprise servers.  It can be used to support communication between a few individuals, or scale to many thousands and more.

Red aims to be skill and resource agnostic. It is easy to use by everyday computer users, as well as by systems administrators and developers. 

How you use it depends on how you want to use it. 

It is written in the PHP scripting language, thus making it trivial to install on any hosting platform in use today. This includes self-hosting at home, at hosting providers such as [url=http://mediatemple.com/]Media Temple[/url] and [url=http://www.dreamhost.com/]Dreamhost[/url], or on virtual and dedicated servers, offered by the likes of [url=https://www.linode.com]Linode[/url],  [url=http://greenqloud.com]GreenQloud[/url] or [url=https://aws.amazon.com]Amazon AWS[/url].

In other words, the Red Matrix can run on any computing platform that comes with a web server, a MySQL-compatible database, and the PHP scripting language. 

Along the way, Red offers a number of unique goodies: 

[b][color= grey]Single-click user identification:[/color][/b] meaning you can access sites on the Red Matrix simply by clicking on links to remote sites. Authentication just happens automagically behind the scenes. Forget about remembering multiple user names with multiple passwords when accessing different sites online.

[b][color= grey]Cloning:[/color][/b] of online identities. Your online presence no longer has to be tied to a single server, domain name or IP address.  You can clone and import your identity (or channel as we call it) to another server (or, a hub as servers are known in the Red Matrix).  Now, should your primary hub go down, no worries, your contacts, posts[i]*[/i], and messages[i]*[/i] will automagically continue to be available and accessible under your cloned channel. [i](*: only posts and messages as from the moment you cloned your channel)[/i]

[b][color= grey]Privacy:[/color][/b]  Red identities (Zot IDs) can be deleted, backed up/downloaded, and cloned.  The user is in full control of their data. Should you decide to delete all your content and erase your Zot ID, all you have to do is click on a link and it's immediately deleted from the hub.  No questions, no fuss.
