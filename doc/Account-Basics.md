Account Basics

* [Home](help)


**Registration**

Not all Red sites allow open registration. If registration is allowed, you will see a "Register" link immediately below the login prompts on the site home page. Following this link will take you to the site Registration page.

*Your Email Address*

Please provide a valid email address. Your email address is **never** published.  This address will be used to (optionally) send email notifications for incoming messages or items, and used to recover lost passwords.

*Password*

Enter a password of your choice, and repeat it in the second box.  As Red offers a decentralised identity, your account can log you in to many other websites.  Because of this, you should use a strong password, even if you initially think of your account as being in the same category as forums.

*Terms Of Servive*

Click the link to read the site's terms of service.  This will open in a new tab.  Once you've read them, tick the box to confirm.

*Register*

Once you have provided the necessary details, click the 'Register' button. An email will be sent to you providing your account login details. Some sites may require administrator approval before the registration is processed, and you will be alerted if this is the case. Please watch your email (including spam folders) for your registration approval. 

*Create a Channel*

Next, you will be presented with the "Add a channel" screen.  Normally, your first channel will be one that represents you - so using your own name (or psuedonym) as the channel name is a good idea.  The channel name should be thought of as a title, or breif description of your channel.  The "choose a short nickname" box is similar to a "username" field.  We will use whatever you enter here to create a channel address, which other people will use to connect to you, and you will use to log in to other sites.  This looks like an email address, and takes the form nickname@siteyouregisteredat.xyz

When your channel is created you will be taken straight to your settings page where you can define permissions, enable features, etc.  All these things are covered in the appropriate section of the helpfiles.
