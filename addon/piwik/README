Online version of this Document: http://ur1.ca/35m2x

___ Requirements ___

To use this plugin you need a "piwik":http://piwik.org installation.

___ Where to find ___

In the Friendika git repository @/addon/piwik/piwik.php@ and a CSS file for
styling the opt-out notice.

___ Configuration ___

Open the .htconfig.php file and add "piwik" to the list of activated addons. 
    $a->config['system']['addon'] = "piwik, ..."
You have to add 3 more configuration variables for the addon:

$a->config['piwik']['baseurl'] = 'example.com/piwik/';
$a->config['piwik']['sideid'] = '1';
$a->config['piwik']['optout'] = true;

The *baseurl* points to your piwik installation. Use the absolute path,
remember trailing slashes but ignore the protocol (http/s) part of the URL.
Change the *sideid* parameter to whatever ID you want to use for tracking your
Friendika installation. The *optout* parameter (true|false) defines whether or
not a short notice about the utilization of piwik will be displayed on every
page of your Friendika site (at the bottom of the page with some spacing to the
other content). Part of the note is a link that allows the visitor to set an
_opt-out_ cookie which will prevent visits from that user be tracked by piwik.

Currently the optional notice states the following:

    This website is tracked using the Piwik analytics tool. If you do not want
    that your visits are logged this way you can set a cookie to prevent Piwik
    from tracking further visits of the site (opt-out).
