Friendika Addon/Plugin development

This is an early specification and hook details may be subject to change.

Please see the sample addon 'randplace' for a working example of using these features.


You must register plugins with the system in the .htconfig.php file.

$a->config['system']['addon'] = 'plugin1name, plugin2name, another_name';

Plugin names cannot contain spaces and are used as filenames.


Register your plugin hooks during installation. 

	register_hook($hookname, $file, $function);

	$hookname is a string and corresponds to a known Friendika hook
	$file is a pathname relative to the top-level Friendika directory.
		This *should* be 'addon/plugin_name/plugin_name.php' in most cases.
	$function is a string and is the name of the function which will be executed
		when the hook is called.


Your hook functions will be called with at least one and possibly two arguments

	function myhook_function(&$a, &$b) {


	}

If you wish to make changes to the calling data, you must declare them as 
reference variables (with '&') during function declaration. 

$a is the Friendika 'App' class - which contains a wealth of information
about the current state of Friendika, such as which module has been called,
configuration info, the page contents at the point the hook was invoked, profile
and user information, etc. It is recommeded you call this '$a' to match its usage 
elsewhere.

$b can be called anything you like. This is information which is specific to the hook 
currently being processed, and generally contains information that is being immediately
processed or acted on that you can use, display, or alter. Remember to declare it with 
'&' if you wish to alter it.
