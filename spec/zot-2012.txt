Initial cut at Zot-2012 protocol. This is a very rough draft of some very rough ideas and concepts. 
It is not yet intended to be a definitive specification and many things like the security handshakes are yet to be specified precisely. 

All communications are https


First create a global unique userid


Site userid:
https://macgirvin.com/1

$guuid = base64url_encode(hash('whirlpool','https://macgirvin.com/1.' . mt_rand(1000000,9999999),1);


Then create a hashed site destination.

$gduid = base64url_encode(hash('whirlpool', $guuid . 'https://macgirvin.com',1);

These two keys will identify you as a person+site pair in the future.
You will also obtain a password upon introducing yourself to a site.
This can be used to edit locations in the future. You will always keep your global unique userid


The steps to connect with somebody are to first register your location with their site.
Then introduce yourself to the person. This contains flags for the desired relationship.
At some future time, they may confirm and adjust the relationship based on their comfort level. 
Lack of confirmation is tantamount to denial. 

You can set either or both of FOLLOW and SHARE which indicates the relationship from your viewpoint.
They may do likewise.

A relationship is based on you as a person and provided you register new locations with the site you can post from anywhere.
You do not need to register locations with each person, only with the site.  


Introduce yourself to a site:


POST https://example.com/post

{
'type' => 'register'
'person' => $guuid
'address' => $gduid
'site' => 'https://macgirvin.com'
'info' => 'mike@macgirvin.com'
}

Returns:

{
'success' => 'true'
'pass' => me_encrypt($random_string)
}

---

---

POST https://example.com/post

{
'type' => 'location'
'person' => $guuid
'address' => $new_gduid
'site' => 'https://newsite.com'
'info' => 'mike@macgirvin.com'
'pass' => me_encrypt($gduid . '.' . $pass)
}

Returns:

{
'success' => 'true'
'pass' => me_encrypt($random_string)
}

---
Remove location
---

POST https://example.com/post

{
'type' => 'remove_location'
'person' => $guuid
'address' => $gduid
'pass' => me_encrypt($pass)
}

Returns:

{
'success' => 'true'
'message' => 'OK'
}


------------
Make friends
------------
This message may be reversed/repeated by the destination site to confirm.
flags is the desired friendship bits. The same message may be used with different flags 
to edit or remove a relationship.

'confirm' => me_encrypt($guuid . '.' . $pass)

'message' => 'OK'
'flags' => PENDING=1
}
